                                    In this experiment, we are going to ask you to complete two tasks that relate to code review.
                                    We will be using examples code commits taken from real-world systems and asking you to evaluate them in different ways.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The tasks will be timed.
                                    The timer can be paused if you get a phone call or want to grab a coffee.
                                    However, please do not pause the timer if you are actively working on the task.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are aware that it may be possible for you to access the actual historic code reviews performed by the systems' original developers.
                                    We respectfully ask you <b>not</b> to do this, so that we can evaluate our research ideas without bias.
                                    However, you are free to use other tools or information sources that you normally use during code reviews.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You will have the opportunity to do a warm-up example for each task; see the <b>Start Practice</b> button below.
                                    These exercises will give you some familiarity with the task workflow, the UI, and the design of the experiment.
                                    The practise exercises will not be timed or evaluated by us.

                                                During the tasks, you will be provided with Gherald risk assessment results regarding the riskiness of change and its relevant author, files, methods.
                                                Specifically, you will be presented with a risk score of change and the prior defect information of its author, files, and methods.
                                                Moreover, Gherald will alert your of the risky lines that are prone to defects when you are reviewing the code diff.

                                                In this experiment, you will be provided with a tool called <b>Infer</b> to assist your completion of tasks.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Infer is a static analysis tool and it can detect bugs in terms of null pointer dereferences, memory leaks, coding conventions and unavailable API’s.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                During the tasks, you will be able to see the output of Infer in the change detail page.
                                                Specifically, you will be presented with an Infer analysis report specifying the detected issues and the problematic line of code.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Please feel free to use Infer as a complementary tool to help with your manual code reviews.

                                            Before you start the real experiment, you'll be able to do a practice round of each task.
                                            This will give you some experience with the workflow of the task, the UI, and the problem space.
                                            We will not evaluate the results of the practice tasks, so take your time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Click on the <b>Start practice</b> button below to give it a try.
                                            Once you have completed the practice, the <b>Start experiment</b> button will be enabled and you'll be able to go on to the actual experiment.

                                            Note that while we are timing your responses, don't think of this as a race.
                                            Take the time you feel that you need to do the task to your satisfaction.

                                            However, please do <b>not</b> pause if you're actively thinking about the task.
